properties:

  charge_current:
    type: integer
    minimum: 0
    description: Specify the active charge current in Amps
  max_current:
    type: integer
    minimum: 0
    description: Dynamically alter the max current while still allowing other claims to very the current via `charge_current` that can not exceede this value. This is primerialy designed for load sharing situations while still allowing things like PV divert to work so the charge current is the minimum of `charge_current` <= `max_current` <= configured soft limit <= hard coded limit
  energy_limit:
    type: integer
    minimum: 0
    format: int32
    description: |-
      Stop the charge after `energy_limit` Wh of energy have been transfered.

      > Note:  Not currently implemented
  time_limit:
    type: integer
    minimum: 0
    format: int32
    description: |-
      Stop the charge after the duration of the charging session has exceeded `time_limit` seconds

      > Note:  Not currently implemented
  auto_release:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      `true` if the manual override is auto-released when the vehicle is
      disconnected, `false` if manual override will persist after vehicle
      disconnection.
